# FEDNEST: Federated Bilevel, Minimax, and Compositional Optimization

![alt ](figs/fig1.png)

This directory contains source code for evaluating federated bilevel learning with different optimizers on various models and tasks.  The code was originally developed for the paper [*FEDNEST: Federated Bilevel, Minimax, and Compositional Optimization*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02215), in ICML 2022. 

The federated code is adopted from [shaoxiongji's](https://github.com/shaoxiongji/federated-learning) implenmentation under MIT license. The bilevel implenmentation follows the algorithm of [*Optimizing Millions of Hyperparameters by Implicit Differentiation (Jonathan Lorraine, Paul Vicol, David Duvenaud)*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02590). The parametric loss tuning experiments on imbalanced dataset follows the loss function design idea of [*AutoBalance: Optimized Loss Functions for
Imbalanced Data(Mingchen Li
, Xuechen Zhang, Christos Thrampoulidis, Jiasi Chen, Samet Oymak)*](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ebQXflQre5a), but we only use MNIST in imbalanced loss function design.

Note: The scripts will be slow without the implementation of parallel computing. 

## Requirements
python>=3.6  
pytorch>=0.4

## Reproduce Run

### Figure 2
![alt](figs/fig2.png)

To reproduce the hyper-representation experiments on MNIST dataset, the [**script**](reproduce/fig2.sh) provides the setup. After running this script, use following command to generate the corresponding figure.
>python reproduce/fig2.py

### Figure 3
![alt](figs/fig31.png)

To reproduce the imbalanced learning experiments on MNIST dataset, the [**script**](reproduce/fig3.sh) provides the setup. After running this script, use following command to generate the corresponding figure.
>python reproduce/fig3.py


### Figure 4
![alt](figs/fig4.png)

For Figure 4, directly runing the jupyter notebook file [minmax_synthetic.ipynb](minmax_synthetic.ipynb) will generate the result.



## Customize Run

The hyper-representation experiments are produced by:
> python [main_hr.py](main_hr.py)

The imbalanced MNIST experiments are produced by:
> python [main_imbalance.py](main_imbalance.py)

The min-max synthetic experiments are produced in the Jupyter Notebook [minmax_synthetic.ipynb](minmax_synthetic.ipynb)

A simple run example is as following
> python main_hr.py --iid --epochs 50 --gpu 0 

By control the augments, there can be more configuration. In the paper, the authors mainly discuss four varients of FedNest. Here we provide the corresponding parameters to run each of them:

![alt 4 main algorithms appears in the paper.](figs/fig_algo.png)

- FedNest
    > --hvp_method global --optim svrg
- LFedNest
    > --hvp_method seperate --optim sgd
- FedNest<sub>SGD</sub>
    > --hvp_method global --optim sgd
- LFedNest<sub>SVRG</sub>
    > --hvp_method seperate --optim svrg

To control the epoch, data distribution (iid or non-iid), inner learning rate, outer learning rate, the arguments are availiable:
> --epoch [epoch number] --iid [default is non-iid, with argument iid client data is iid] --hlr [outer learning rate] --lr [inner learning rate]


More arguments are avaliable in [options.py](utils/options.py).
